Heart Disease Predictor - A machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on clinical parameters such as age, sex, cholesterol level, blood pressure, and more. This model aims to assist in early diagnosis and preventive healthcare using data-driven insights.

Objective - The goal of this project is to build a reliable predictive model that can identify whether a patient is at risk of heart disease using supervised machine learning algorithms.

Features
* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for deeper insights
* Training with multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.)
* Model evaluation with metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
* Optional web app interface built with Streamlit/Flask for real-time predictions

Tech Stack
* Programming Language: Python
* Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Deployment (optional): Streamlit or Flask

Dataset
Dataset Source: Kaggle Heart Disease Dataset

Project Workflow - 
* Data Preprocessing – Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, normalize features.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualize data distributions and correlations.
* Model Training – Train multiple models and compare performance.
* Evaluation – Evaluate using metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curve).
* Deployment – Optional: create a user interface for predictions.

Results
* Achieved model accuracy of around 85.86.
* Random Forest / Logistic Regression provided the best performance.
